        <p align="left-align"><h3>What are the Advantage of Reckon Online Education</h3> </p>

          <p align="justify">Reckon Online courses are more convenient and cheaper than their counterparts in class room coaching, The best thing about online learning is that you can learn in a relaxed manner, with your passion for learning and cracking GATE and ESE-2018, Rather than miss important class sessions, students in online courses can always “attend” watching video any time they prefer and by participating on discussion boards or in chat sessions,  or read study materials. Many students also find that the amount they save on fuel costs can be substantial if they don’t have to commute to a physical campus in general, no matter what the weather conditions may be.


<p align="justify"><b>You can learn whatever you want: </b>Reckon Civil Academy, gives you the option to choose the course you want, Basic (only certain Chapter), Pro(Entire Subject),Professional (Entire GATE & ESE).
 For example, let’s say you’re only interested in one chapter “slope deflection Method” of Structural Analysis (opt Basic), or you only want to study Geotech (most weighted subject of GATE and ESE) (opt Pro) or you are fresh student who want to study complete GATE and ESE (opt Professional), You can pick any of the option without involving traveling away from home, living in a completely unknown city, and struggling with day to day activity,</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Lower Costs: </b>The fact that Reckon online course is cheaper when compared to the traditional class room classes is enough to convince students to consider Reckon. The average fees for class room coaching are Rs70,000 with multiple extra expenses but least flexibility, like you can’t attend one subject or one chapter but Reckon online Classes gives you freedom to choose your learning as you want with easy installments.
Comfort: Students can study  when they are at their peak energy, whether that’s early morning or late at night. Forget about attending classes for hours, sitting in an uncomfortable chair, and suffering from back pain ,You will not be bound to physical class session when you opt for reckon online education. All lectures and needed materials are provided via online platforms, so you’ll easily access them from the comfort of your home. You will not take public transport to get to coaching classes, you won’t have to spend money on petrol for your vehicle, you won’t have to get up early to get dressed for class… the list of conveniences goes on and on.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Self-Paced Learning:</b> When  you start browsing through Reckon Civil Academy online courses, you’ll notice the Self-Paced label on most of them. What does this mean? Self-paced learning means that the students can start completing the targets at any time, and he can arrange a learning schedule that meets his individual needs. 
When you enroll in a traditional class room coaching, you’ll have to pace the study according to coaching class schedule and mostly students are unable to pace with classes and starting lacking behind and finally quitting the preparation but a self-paced system enables student to make progress with rhythm that suits them. This type of system does not require attending live classes you can access the video or materials at any time that works for you. If you have to work, attend college or take care of your home during the day, you can study at night. That’s an advantage the traditional coaching classes cannot meet.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>More Interaction and Greater Ability to Concentrate:</b> Online courses offer shy or more reticent students the opportunity to participate in class discussions or chats with more ease than face-to-face class sessions. students even feel  that online courses are easier to concentrate in because they are not distracted by other students and classroom activity, Students also get distracted by writing the notes as faculty of the class will not speak or write that thing again on broad but in online classes students able to get more concentration as they are not worry of missing as videos are available to them any time and as many times as they wish.
All of this makes online learning a good option for students who need to balance their college  or work commitments. </p>
